# Tango Pipe specification

This specification describes the Tango Pipe feature of a Device. 

## Goals

Tango Pipe is an Attribute [RFC-4] with custom data structure - the pipe name and pipe description.
But in contrary of Commands or Attributes, a pipe does not have a pre-defined data type: it may be of any basic Tango data type (or array of) and this may change every time a pipe is read or written.

## Use Case

1. To pass big pieces of data structure at a time
2. To define complex data structures to act as a single Attribute

## Specification

Device MAY define zero, one or more Pipes.

Pipe MUST have static metadata:

 * name
 * description
 * label
 * level
 * writeType
 * writable

```abnf
name = TangoName

description = DevString [link to RFC-9 Data Types]

label = DevString [link to RFC-9 Data Types]

level = "OPERATOR"/"USER"

writeType = "PIPE_READ"/"PIPE_WRITE"

writable = DevBoolean
```

Pipe name MUST follow Tango naming conventions.

Pipe with writeType="PIPE_READ" MUST be read only.

Pipe data structure MUST be:

 * Key(s) -> Value(s)

```abnf
Key = DevString [link to RFC-9 Data Types]

Value = Scalar or Array of Any Tango compliant type or Pipe [link to RFC-9 Data Types]
```

In Tango 9 "DevPipeBlob" is used to describe Value (see image below).

> **V10 NOTE:** Attribute being a corner case of a Pipe can be considered as a derivative of a Pipe.

### Pipe events

Pipe MUST NOT be polled.

Pipe MAY emit an event via Server API call.

### Server/Client APIs

Server API MUST provide a set of methods for a Server Client code to define a Pipe.

Server API MUST provide a way to fill the Pipe with data.

Client API MAY provide a way to obtain Pipe schema.

Client API MUST provide methods for a client to fetch Pipe data from a Device.

Client API MUST provide methods to traverse Pipe structure.
